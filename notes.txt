Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code during software development.
It allows multiple developers to collaborate on the same project without overwriting each other's work.
Git stores code history as a series of commits, making it easy to review or revert changes.
Branches in Git let you experiment with features without affecting the main codebase.
Git integrates with platforms like GitHub to enable remote collaboration and code sharing.
